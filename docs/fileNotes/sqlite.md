# SQLite

[`db/sqlite.py`](../../db/sqlite.py) is Jane's connection and query layer.
[`db/schema.py`](../../db/schema.py) holds the big table and index setup that
used to make `sqlite.py` rather unpleasant to read.

## What It Handles

- stores Jane's main database at repo-root `bot.db`
- opens one shared `aiosqlite` connection
- enables connection pragmas like foreign keys, busy timeout, WAL, and normal synchronous mode
- asks `db/schema.py` to create or update tables and indexes during startup
- tracks schema version with SQLite `PRAGMA user_version`
- exposes small query/write helpers for feature modules

## Startup Shape

`bot.py` calls `initDb()` through the bootstrap coordinator before cogs are loaded.

The important startup flow is:

1. open the shared connection and wait out short-lived database locks
2. run the schema setup in one transaction
3. create anything missing and bring old databases forward
4. record the new schema version only after everything worked

The current version is 30. That version properly records the training-result
export table that was added without a version bump earlier.

## Main Helper Functions

### `fetchOne(query, params=())`

Runs a read query and returns one row as a plain `dict`, or `None`.

### `fetchAll(query, params=())`

Runs a read query and returns a list of plain `dict` rows.

### `execute(query, params=())`

Runs one write under `_dbWriteLock` and commits immediately.

### `executeReturnId(query, params=())`

Runs one insert/update under `_dbWriteLock`, commits, and returns `lastrowid`.

### `executeMany(query, paramsSeq)`

Runs a batch write under `_dbWriteLock`; returns early for an empty batch.

These write helpers all use the same commit/rollback behavior.

### `runWriteTransaction(callback)`

Runs a callback inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, commits on success, and rolls back on exception.

Use this when a feature needs several related writes to succeed or fail together. The callback receives the raw `aiosqlite.Connection`, so it should stay narrow and should not call the higher-level helpers from inside the transaction.

### `closeDb()`

Closes and clears the shared connection during shutdown.

## Table Groups

The schema is dense because almost every feature has at least one table here.

### Sessions / BG Checks / Orientation

- `sessions`
- `attendees`
- `bg_review_actions`

These back orientation sessions, certification sessions, BG queue routing, BG review decisions, and Roblox scan state. Orientation data lives here, not in the recruitment logging tables.

### Points

- `points`
- `points_pending`

`points_pending` is used when a review action credits points that should be processed later. Recruitment review approvals queue points here, then the recruitment payout maintenance path moves them into `points`. That payout is manual-only unless `automaticRecruitmentPayoutEnabled` is explicitly enabled in config.

### Recruitment / ANRORS Logging

- `recruitment_submissions`
- `recruitment_time_submissions`
- `recruitment_patrol_sessions`
- `recruitment_patrol_attendees`

These are the ANRORS recruitment logging tables. Standard recruitment review messages use `config.recruitmentChannelId`, solo time-log review messages use `config.recruitmentTimeLogReviewChannelId`, group patrol review messages use `config.recruitmentPatrolReviewChannelId`, and group patrol screenshot collection uses `config.recruitmentPatrolEvidenceChannelId`.

For new recruitment and patrol submissions, `channelId` and `messageId` should end up pointing at the review message Jane posted, not just the channel where the slash command was used. The row is created before the review message exists, then the recruitment service updates the stored message location after posting.

That matters during a recruitment logging server/channel move: future submissions follow config, while old rows still point to their original review messages. A few older rows may still point at the submitter's channel from before that handoff was cleaned up, so lookup code should be a little forgiving. Orientation and BG review channel config are separate unless that infrastructure is intentionally moving too.

### ORBAT / LOA

- `orbat_requests`
- `loa_requests`

These store Discord-side request/review state. Sheet writes and layout details live in `features/staff/orbat`, `features/staff/departmentOrbat`, and `config.py`.

### Applications

- `division_applications`
- `division_application_events`
- `division_hub_messages`

These power division application submission, review, hub messages, and event history.

### Ribbons

- `ribbon_assets`
- `ribbon_profiles`
- `ribbon_requests`
- `ribbon_request_proofs`
- `ribbon_request_events`

These store scanned ribbon catalog metadata, user ribbon profiles, request state, proof attachments, and request event history.

### Training Logs / Event Ingest

- `john_event_log_messages`
- `training_result_logs`

These support John/event-log ingestion, training result mirroring, and host stats.

### Staff / Workflow Features

- `department_projects`
- `department_project_history`
- `anrd_payment_requests`
- `workflow_runs`
- `workflow_events`

`workflow_runs` and `workflow_events` are generic review-workflow tracking tables used by newer staff systems.

### Operations / Runtime

- `curfew_targets`
- `jail_records`
- `guild_feature_flags`
- `audit_events`
- `assistant_notes`
- `guild_federation_links`
- `retry_jobs`
- `db_schema_migrations`

These are mostly operational state, runtime auditability, feature flags, retry queue state, and migration bookkeeping.

### Community / Misc

- `scheduled_events`
- `scheduled_event_rsvps`
- `best_of_polls`
- `best_of_poll_candidates`
- `best_of_poll_votes`
- `best_of_poll_section_votes`
- `community_polls`
- `community_poll_votes`
- `reminders`
- `suggestions`
- `suggestion_status_boards`
- `guild_stats_snapshots`
- `guild_member_activity_daily`
- `guild_channel_activity_daily`
- `hall_reaction_posts`
- `silly_gambling_wallets`
- `silly_gambling_api_credits`
- `bunny_certification`

Some of these are legacy or oddball features, but they are still part of live database initialization unless the table is explicitly removed from the schema.

## Migration Notes

The migration style is intentionally simple:

- new tables use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- additive columns are usually done with `_executeOptional("ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...")`
- schema version is only bumped at the end of `schema.applySchema(...)`

`_executeOptional(...)` only ignores the harmless "already exists" cases. Other
errors stop startup, and the transaction rolls back instead of leaving half a
migration behind. When changing the schema, bump the version and try it against
both a fresh database and a copy of an older one.

There is no down-migration system. Treat schema edits as forward-only.

## Things To Be Careful About

- Do not call write helpers from inside `runWriteTransaction(...)`; they will try to take `_dbWriteLock` again.
- Keep DB writes short. The shared write lock protects Jane from concurrent SQLite write errors, but long callbacks can stall unrelated features.
- Do not casually rename/drop columns. Many services read raw dict keys directly.
- Remember that several rows store Discord message locations. Moving a channel does not rewrite old `channelId` / `messageId` pairs.
- Back up `bot.db` before risky schema edits. Runtime backups exist, but development edits should still be deliberate.
- If a feature needs cross-table consistency, use `runWriteTransaction(...)` instead of separate `execute(...)` calls.

## Good Small Edits Here

- add a missing index for a proven slow lookup
- add a new table for a feature with a narrow service module
- add one additive column with a clear default
- move repeated multi-write feature logic into `runWriteTransaction(...)`
- document a table group here after touching it
